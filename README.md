**Project Architecture:**

The project follows a typical client-server architecture, where the client-side is implemented using React for the web application, and the server-side can be implemented using any backend technology (Node.js). The client-side React application communicates with the server-side backend to perform tasks such as image processing, OCR (Optical Character Recognition), and data extraction from driver's licenses.

**Chosen Technologies:**

1. **Frontend:**
   - React: For building the user interface and managing application state.
   - React Webcam: For capturing images from the device's webcam.
   - React Dropzone: For allowing users to upload images.
   - OCR (Optical Character Recognition) library: Used for extracting text data from images.
   - Styling libraries (Tailwind CSS, CSS modules): For styling the user interface.

2. **Backend (Assumed, Not Specified in Provided Code):**
   - Node.js with Express.js: For building a simple server to handle image processing and OCR tasks.
   - Tesseract.js or Google Cloud Vision API: For performing OCR on images to extract text data from driver's licenses.

**Obstacles Encountered and Assumptions Made:**

1. **Limitations of OCR:** OCR can sometimes struggle with low-quality images, distorted text, or unusual fonts. Handling these edge cases effectively can be challenging and may require additional preprocessing steps or using more advanced OCR techniques.

2. **Parsing Different State Licenses:** Each state may have different formats and layouts for driver's licenses, making it necessary to have specific parsing rules for each state. Currently, the functionality is only completed for the state of Virginia (assumption based on the provided code). Extending this functionality to cover licenses from other states would require additional parsing rules and possibly more advanced text recognition techniques.

3. **Assumption about the Camera or License:** The application assumes that users have access to a device with a webcam for capturing images of driver's licenses. Additionally, it assumes that the driver's licenses being processed follow a standard format, with consistent placement of relevant information such as name, address, and DL issuance & expiration date.

**Potential Improvements:**

1. **Use Commercial Document Recognition Solution:** Integrating with a commercial OCR solution that specializes in processing driver's licenses could improve accuracy and handle edge cases more effectively.

2. **Preprocessing of Input Images:** Implementing preprocessing techniques such as image enhancement, noise reduction, and image rotation can improve OCR accuracy, especially for low-quality or skewed images.

3. **Add More Parsing Rules:** Extending the application to cover driver's licenses from all states would require implementing parsing rules specific to each state's license format. This would involve analyzing the layout and structure of licenses from different states and adapting the parsing logic accordingly.

4. **Use Deep Learning Techniques:** Leveraging deep learning techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image processing and text recognition can potentially enhance the accuracy and robustness of the text extraction process, especially for complex or non-standard license formats.
